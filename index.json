Gene search is quick and user friendly, and it connects to a page devoted to the specific gene, which displays a variety of cilia-related information about that gene.\nCilioGenics also provides a number of resources to:\n  explore the evolutionary dynamics ( the comparative genomics) of each gene in the interactive heatmap\n  explore the expression patterns of each gene (whole organisms in C. elegans, and lung tissue in human)\n  view proteomics relationship between ciliary proteins and other proteins\n  search for the name of gene in each cilia related publications\n  ","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://mustafapir.github.io/CV/project/example/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/CV/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"An example of using the in-built project page.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Example Project","type":"project"},{"authors":["\\**Mustafa S Pir\\**","Halil I Bilgin","Ahmet Sayici","Fatih Co≈ükun","Furkan M Torun","Pei Zhao","Yahong Kang","Sebiha Cevik","Oktay I Kaplan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649079590,"objectID":"12e517d1ca95c45ed2422fac9a4d9a3b","permalink":"https://mustafapir.github.io/CV/publication/10-1093-nargkab-939/","publishdate":"2022-04-04T13:39:49.531642Z","relpermalink":"/CV/publication/10-1093-nargkab-939/","section":"publication","summary":"The availability of genetic variants, together with phenotypic annotations from model organisms, facilitates comparing these variants with equivalent variants in humans. However, existing databases and search tools do not make it easy to scan for equivalent variants, namely ‚Äòmatching variants‚Äô (MatchVars) between humans and other organisms. Therefore, we developed an integrated search engine called ConVarT (http://www.convart.org/) for matching variants between humans, mice, and Caenorhabditis elegans. ConVarT incorporates annotations (including phenotypic and pathogenic) into variants, and these previously unexploited phenotypic MatchVars from mice and C. elegans can give clues about the functional consequence of human genetic variants. Our analysis shows that many phenotypic variants in different genes from mice and C. elegans, so far, have no counterparts in humans, and thus, can be useful resources when evaluating a relationship between a new human mutation and a disease.","tags":[],"title":"ConVarT: a search engine for matching human genetic variants with variants from non-human species","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mustafa Samet Pir","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
